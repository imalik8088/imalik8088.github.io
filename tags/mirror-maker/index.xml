      <description>Recently I got the chance to help a customer moving from a Helm based deployment of Apache Kafka in Kubernetes to the Strimzi, which manages the deployment of Kafka in Kubernetes with an operator. In the final phase, I had to transfer the data to the newly deployed Apache Kafka.
Setting the scope The customer is using compacted topics (cleanup.policy=compact and log.rentention.ms=-1) as the default configuration for all topics in Apache Kafka, so they&amp;rsquo;re using it somehow like a database where messages are produced with an unique ID and are nulled afterwards when it is required to delete a message.</description>
