Because the state of a Kafka-Streams application is stored in Kafka, and it can build up the state after a redeployment from so-called changelog topics, therefore Kafka-Streams is also bounded to have source and sink to Apache Kafka.
Apache Flink on the other hand has the freedom to choose from a variety of source systems, e.</description>
