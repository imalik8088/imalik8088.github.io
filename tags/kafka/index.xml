      <description>Recently I got the chance to help a customer moving from a Helm based deployment of Apache Kafka in Kubernetes to the Strimzi, which manages the deployment of Kafka in Kubernetes with an operator. In the final phase, I had to transfer the data to the newly deployed Apache Kafka.
Setting the scope The customer is using compacted topics (cleanup.policy=compact and log.rentention.ms=-1) as the default configuration for all topics in Apache Kafka, so they&amp;rsquo;re using it somehow like a database where messages are produced with an unique ID and are nulled afterwards when it is required to delete a message.</description>

&amp;ldquo;ETL with Kafka&amp;rdquo; is a catchy phrase that I purposely chose for this post instead of a more precise title like &amp;ldquo;Building a data pipeline with Kafka Connect&amp;rdquo;.
TLDR You donâ€™t need to write any code for pushing data into Kafka, instead just choose your connector and start the job with your necessary configurations. And itâ€™s absolutely Open Source!
Kafka Connect Kafka Before getting into the Kafka Connect framework, let us briefly sum up what Apache Kafka is in couple of lines.</description>
