      <description>In a stateful streaming application the state of an application is one of the most important part. In Apache Flink we have the possibility to kind of backup the state with a so called savepointing mechanism. From these savepoints you as a developer or operations manager are able to stop-and-resume, fork, or update your Flink jobs (more to read about savepoints in the docs). So it&amp;rsquo;s a great possibility to try out different implementations of a fork for a Flink application.</description>
