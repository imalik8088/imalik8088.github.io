There are so many great blogs around the in the web where I have benefiting from and now just want to contribute back and publish some words about my technical journey and reflect on my daily job as an IT-Consultant based in Germany. So lets see if this will be just a good intention or really awesome source of wisdom for technies - just kidding.

So what's the deal, what can you expect from this blog? In short I'll working around the following topics: **BigData**, **DevOps**, **Frontend**, **Microservices** and **Cloud**. Thats my space where I want to invest in the near future. What you shouldn't expect a is perfect gramatacilly written posts, due to the lack of native German language. And you should expect to try explain things like the following Javascript code.

The magic of Javascript

``` js
['10','10','10','10','10'].map(parseInt)
// output: [10, NaN, 2, 3, 4]
```

The blog is based on [jekyll][jekyll] and [GitHub Pages][gh-pages].
